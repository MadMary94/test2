					<h2>My Strengths</h2> 
					<p class="text-centre"> My strengths are countless. But I will try to narrow them down. I excel at team work, along with working individually. Although I have merely begun my Computing course, I have taken to it like a fish to water.
						From playing many team sports I have developed many skills such as leadership, being a team player and also learned how to handle defeat, as well as success. </p>

						<p class="text-center-left"> I started off my learning experience in my humble home of Creeslough, Co. Donegal. Scoil Mhuire Creeslough was not a big school by any means, but it had a big heart. 
						I then progessed to Loreto Convent Letterkenny, where I grew even more, and entered womanhood. </p>

						<p class="text-centre"> 
						I have travelled down many career paths in my short life, starting off working in a creche, near my family home. I then moved on to aid my father in the motor shop he owns from ages 14-16. 
						The bar game then called my name and I began employment in Rose's Bar Creeslough, mainstreet Creeslough. I worked there for three years, getting to know the locals, developing my witty sense of humour.
